# Solutions for advent of code 2019

Here you can (eventually) find all solutions and tests that I used for solving each day of advent of code 2019.

Info on advent of code [here](https://adventofcode.com/2019/about).

Event [here](https://adventofcode.com/2019).

I find python to be my go to language when I need to code something quick. Before learning a brand new language I decided to deepened my knowledge of one I already know a little beforehand. So, My goal here is first to solve each day of the event while not being rushed. I'll try to complete it before the 2020 edition. Since I have the opportunity of taking my time, my priority is to write code that follow good practices and learn as much as possible about python along the way.

Each folder contain code and input for testing and solving each day. The first dependency needed is of course [python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/), other dependencies will be specified in the folder README.

Enjoy!
