# Solutions for advent of code 2019

Here you can find (eventually) all solutions and tests that I used for solving each day of advent 2019.

Info on advent of code [here](https://adventofcode.com/2019/about).
Event [here](https://adventofcode.com/2019).

I really like python and use this to deepen my understanding of it. My goal here is not only solve each problem efficiently, but to write clean and easily understandable code and tests. I come back regularly to refactor past solutions.

Each folder contain code and input for testing and solving each day. The only dependency needed is [python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/). How to test your own input could differ from day to day and will be specified in the folder README.

Enjoy!
