# Day 4

[Instructions](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/4)

This one was quicker to complete than the one from yesterday. A set of rules must be applied to all six digit number between a given range. Once again I applied what was coded for part one in part two. I could have used the same function for both parts, but I find it easier to read that way (which is still kind of my goal).

To run with a different input, change the two constants START_VALUE and END_VALUE.
