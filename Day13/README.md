# Day 13

[Instructions](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/13)

It took me a little time understanding the output of the Intcode for this day. Once I had it, the problem became simple. This is why I lost I don't know how many hours to make it work with Pygame and have a brick break that play itself. It's pretty neat thought, not gonna lie.

EDIT:
I BROKE IT ðŸ˜¢
It's probably [not that bad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%BCbler-Ross_model) but it's not working at the moment.
