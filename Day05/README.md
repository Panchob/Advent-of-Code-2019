# Day 5

[Instructions](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/5)

I should have put this code on github way earlier for day 5. This way I could have seen all my iteration of the "position" function. It took me I don't know how many tries to have it working the way I wanted. Mainly because I came back to it (like i did for day 2) to adapt it for later.

Here I had to add some opcode and a new logic (immediate and position mode). I mainly use the same format as in day2 and added a function to compute the position which will come handy later. I really like the principle of incrementing on code written in previous days. I look forward to see what it will look like when completed.
