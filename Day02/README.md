# Day 2

[Instructions](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/2)

I came back to refactor day 2 since I had to reuse it (a lot) in the future. It's only the base of an intCode computer interpreter/compiler which will become relatively complex (looking at you day 9). My goal was to have good foundations before starting day 5 which will also add new logic to this.

The output of this code depend on what is given in the initial input, as stated in the instructions. The code must be executed separately with both input to have both answers.
